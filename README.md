This project implements a basic Hospital Management System using Java, incorporating key object-oriented principles such as inheritance and interfaces.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h3>Object-Oriented Design:</h3>
Utilizes inheritance to model relationships between different types of classes (e.g., Hospital, Doctor, Inventory, Patients).
Employs interfaces to define common functionalities for various entities (e.g., getDetails, setDetails).

Basic Hospital Management:
Handles patient registration.
Handles Doctors Addition into System.
Manages staff records and schedules.
May include basic features like inventory tracking.

<h3>Data Handling:</h3>
Potentially uses simple data structures like arrays or collections to store and manage data.

<h3>User Interface:</h3>
Includes a basic command-line interface or a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
Demonstrate understanding of core Java concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and object-oriented programming principles.
Develop a practical application that simulates a basic hospital management system.
Explore data structures and algorithms for managing hospital data.

<h3>Note:</h3>
This is a basic project and may not include all the functionalities of a real-world hospital management system.
The project is intended for educational purposes and to showcase the application of core Java concepts.
